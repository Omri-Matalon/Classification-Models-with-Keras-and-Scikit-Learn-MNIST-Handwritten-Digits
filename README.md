# Classification-Models-with-Keras-and-Scikit-Learn-MNIST-Handwritten-Digits

In this project, classification of handwritten digits will be performed using the Keras and Scikit-learn libraries.

Images of digits will be obtained from the MNIST dataset, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits written by students and employees.
